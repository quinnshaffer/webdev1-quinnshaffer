  At first glance, the internet may seem absolutely flawless. It connects people all around the world, and offers infinite free knowledge with a few clicks. 
  It can creat the appearance of an even playing field, by putting everyday people on the same platforms as positions of power, but that can be a double edged sword, allowing for conspiracy theories
  and misinformation to spread, while actual experts can be ignored. Even still, it's inifinite potential cannot be ignored. That said, it is really in entertainment were the internet shines, bringin us videos and music 
  on demand, often for free, and often origional. It allows for any creator to share what they m,ake with the world and recieve infinite feedback.

<p>It is for theses reasons that despite some glaring flaws, I award the internet with four starts out of five. It has some real potential, and I can honestly see it catching on.</p>
